    <h1>Eritrea the horn of Africa</h1>
    <p>The Italians created the colony of Eritrea in the 
        19th century around Asmara and named it with its c
        urrent name. After World War II, Eritrea annexed
         to Ethiopia. Following the communist Ethiopian
          government's defeat in 1991 by the coalition 
          created by armed groups notably the
         EPLF, Eritrea declared its independence.</p>
